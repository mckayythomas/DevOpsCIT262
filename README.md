## About Me

I am McKay Thomas. I am from Portland, Oregon but I live in Arequipa Peru with my wife. She is originally from her and we love it here.
This is a picture of us:

I currently work as a full-stack developer at a small company with one other dev. Due to our small team, we both pretty much do everything including application security, testing, deploying infrastructure and database management. I have learned a lot over the past year working for them. I am currently looking for a new job doing similar work. I would love to work more with C# although I love using typescript and Python in my current work. I am looking for jobs in full-stack development and cyber security as I also love working with security problems and principles. I would love to work for Crowdstrike one day as well doing cybersecurity work.
